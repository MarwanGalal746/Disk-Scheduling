  <h1>Disk scheduling</h1>

## 📙 Summary

> Hey! Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule IO requests arriving for the disk, this project simulates some disk scheduling algorithms.
>
> The algorithms which simulated in this project:
>
> > 1- **FCFS:** It is the simplest of all the Disk Scheduling Algorithms. In FCFS, the requests are addressed in the order they arrive in the disk queue.
>
> > 2- **SSTF:**  (Shortest Seek Time First): It requests having shortest seek time are executed first.
>
> > 3- **SCAN:** In SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, head starts from one end of the disk and moves towards the other end, servicing requests in between one by one and reach the other end. Then the direction of the head is reversed and the process continues as head continuously scan back and forth to access the disk.
>
> >4- **C-SCAN:**
>
> >5- **LOOK**: It is advanced version of SCAN disk scheduling with a better seek time, it is like SCAN algorithm but it also looks ahead for more requests to be serviced in the same direction, if there are no pending requests in the the head then we reverse direction and start servicing requests in the opposite direction.

> >6- **C-LOOK:**
