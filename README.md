  <h1>Disk scheduling</h1>

## 📙 Summary

> Hey! Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule IO requests arriving for the disk, this project simulates some disk scheduling algorithms.
>
> The algorithms which simulated in this project:
>
> > 1- **FCFS:** It is the simplest of all the Disk Scheduling Algorithms. In FCFS, the requests are addressed in the order they arrive in the disk queue.
>
> > 2- **SSTF:**  (Shortest Seek Time First): It requests having shortest seek time are executed first.
>
> > 3- **SCAN:** 
>
> >4- **C-SCAN:**
>
> >5- **LOOK**: 
>
> >6- **C-LOOK:**
